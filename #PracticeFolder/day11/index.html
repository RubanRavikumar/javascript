        A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit”
        (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. 
        For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
        A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.
